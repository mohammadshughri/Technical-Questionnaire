# User Management Screen
## Requirements
The User Management is a web-based application that allows administrators to manage users in the system. 

The application should have the following features:

- Add new users to the system
- View a list of all users in the system
- Use various filters to sort the users

## UI Components
The User Management should include the following UI components:

- User List: A table that displays a list of all users in the system. Each row in the table should include the ID, user's name, email address, status (Enabled/Disabled), and to filter the users based on one of the previous attributes.
- Add User Form: A form that allows the administrator to add a new user to the system. The form should include fields for the username, display name, phone number, email address, user role, and the status of the user.

| ID  | UserName   | Email Address          | Current Status|
|-----|----------- |-----------------------|---------------|
| 1   | Admin      | Adminuser@piworks.net | True          |
